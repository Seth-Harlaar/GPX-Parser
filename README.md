# GPX-Parser
A full-stack web application using Node.js with MySQL database for storing and analyzing GPS routes

Tech stack:
- C
- HTML
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Express.js
- MySQL

This application was a semester long project that I developed during my completion of the CIS*2750 course at the University of Guelph during my Computer Engineering degree. 

## Directory Explanation
The branches of GPX-Parser represent each stage of the application developement. The application was developed in 4 stages, each making up one assignment for the course.
- The **master** branch includes the files that were given at the beginning of the semester as a starting point for each student.
- The **A1** branch was the beginning steps of build a custom C parser that would dissect GPX formatted files.
- The **A2** branch builds on the parser, where extra functionality was implemented to validea the GPX files submitted to the application.
- In the **A3** branch, the GUi was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users could parse files and view information about them.
- In the **A4** branch, persistent storage was implemented via MySQL. Users could upload files to the server, view previously uploaded files, and make changes to files on the server.
